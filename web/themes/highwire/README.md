# Custom Site Theme Directory
This is where site specific theme should be placed. Thanks!

Please observe the 'config -> theme-directories' definition in the site repo composer.json file, you need to update YOUR_THEME to your theme dir, such as scolaris_mhe or scolaris_pmr.
Note, you will also need to bring over the compile.yml file from MHE or PMR and place it in the theme root directory.
